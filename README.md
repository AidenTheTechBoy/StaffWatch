# StaffWatch.app
Staff Watch gives you the ability to remove those toxic people breaking the rules so your server can truly be the best it can be.

## The Project
Running a FiveM server is fun at times, but frustrating at others. There is nothing more annoying then a couple of kids raiding your server, then leaving before you can ban them with vMenu or EasyAdmin. Staff Watch will prevent this and much more.

## Setup
Setup instructions can be found [on the wiki](https://github.com/AidenTheTechBoy/StaffWatch/wiki)
